1. zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are known for their compact proofs and fast verification.
   They're great for quick checks in cases like blockchain transactions. But they also need an additional initial trusted setup.

2. zkSTARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) are newer and focus on handling bigger and more complex proofs
   efficiently. They skip the trusted setup part, which makes them more transparent and theoretically safer in some ways. However, they
   tend to have larger proofs and can take longer to verify compared to zkSNARKs.

3. Re-entrancy attack can be mitigated by following the Check,Effect,Implication(CEI) pattern while writing the smart contract. Another
   way to mitigate it is to start using Re-entrancy guard by Open-Zeppelin on certain functions.
