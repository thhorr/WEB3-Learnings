1. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow you to prove something is true without revealing the details. 
   These proofs are essential for ensuring privacy, security, and scalability in web3 applications like private transactions, 
   decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. 

2. zkVerify isn't just another blockchain; it's a blockchain purpose-built for ZKPs verification.

3. Puppy Raffle Audit:

   a. If a `for loop` is seen in the SC maybe its prone to a Denial Of Service (DOS) attack.So better watch out for this while doing auditing.
   b. DOS can happen also because of External Call to a function failing , Blocking of gas limit.

4. Slashing occurs when a validator has provably acted against the Ethereum network. Slashing doesn’t need to have malicious intent necessarily for example,
   it could   happen from misconfiguration. The validator acted in a way the can confuse or disrupt the integrity of the system It removes, or ‘slashes’,
   a portion of the offending validators existing stake, causing a gradual loss of ETH over time until the validator is forcefully ejected and marked as SLASHED.
   This is irreversible.

5. Slashing is not to be confused with inactivity penalties, which are normal loss of funds incurred over time the longer your validator is offline and unable
   to perform its duties. A validator that correctly follows the protocol never emits a slashable vote in normal operations. Validators will not be slashed for
   simply being offline.
