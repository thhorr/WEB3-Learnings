1. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow you to prove something is true without revealing the details. 
   These proofs are essential for ensuring privacy, security, and scalability in web3 applications like private transactions, 
   decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. 

2. zkVerify isn't just another blockchain; it's a blockchain purpose-built for ZKPs verification.
