1. zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are known for their compact proofs and fast verification.
   They're great for quick checks in cases like blockchain transactions. But they also need an additional initial trusted setup.

2. zkSTARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) are newer and focus on handling bigger and more complex proofs
   efficiently. They skip the trusted setup part, which makes them more transparent and theoretically safer in some ways. However, they
   tend to have larger proofs and can take longer to verify compared to zkSNARKs.

3. Re-entrancy attack can be mitigated by following the Check,Effect,Implication(CEI) pattern while writing the smart contract. Another
   way to mitigate it is to start using Re-entrancy guard by Open-Zeppelin on certain functions.

4. Even though Tornado Cash's front-end interface and official repositories were taken down following the sanctions, the protocol itself remains operational on the
   Ethereum blockchain. Users with the technical know-how can interact directly with Tornado Cash smart contracts using decentralized tools like :

   Etherscan : The smart contracts can be accessed and triggered through blockchain explorers.
   Command-line interfaces (CLI) : Experienced users can bypass user interfaces (UIs) and interact directly with Tornado Cash contracts.
   Custom-built interfaces : Individuals could create their own front-end interfaces to interact with the Tornado Cash contract without relying on the now-banned web interfaces.

5. Thus decentralization ensures that as long as the Ethereum blockchain exists, so too will Tornado Cashâ€™s functionality, even if its developers or platforms face
   legal issues.
